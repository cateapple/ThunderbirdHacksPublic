Our independent variables are in the X dataset (or what would go on the x-axis), which represent the features or characteristics of the data. The dependent variable is in the y dataset (or what would go on the y-axis), which represents the target or class label we want to predict. We know that our dependent variables depend on our independent variables some way. \n\nOftentimes, information in the X dataset will give us hints as to what the corresponding label in the y dataset is. For example, if we're trying to figure out if an animal is a cat or a dog, having information on the animal's weight, height, fur color and more can be very useful. Then, once we have those values, we can guess if the animal is a cat or dog with confidence!\n\nNow, it's pretty easy for humans to look at an animal and figure out if it's a cat or dog without considering those factors. We just use our eyes! But for a machine learning model, it's not so easy. It has to learn the relationship between the information in the X dataset and the corresponding label in the y dataset. Then, it can make predictions on new data.\n\nIn the graph below, let's pretend all green dots are cats and all red dots are dogs. See how they're clustered together? The goal of the machine learning model is to be able to properly categorize a new purple dot as cat or dog given what it's learned.\n\n![graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/K_nearest_neighbour_explain.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Back to coding\n\nNow, we'll split the data up even further, into a training set and a validation set.

Imagine you have a dataset with different features (like height, weight, and age) and a \"y\" column that tells you what category each item belongs to (like \"cat\" or \"dog\").\n\nHere's how KNN works:\n\n1. Choose a number - This is how many neighbors you want to look at. For example, if you chose 3, you'll look at the three closest items to the one you're trying to classify.\n\n2. Find the neighbors - For a new item (like a new animal), you calculate how close it is to all the items in your dataset using their features. You can use a distance formula, like the Euclidean distance, to find out which items are closest.\n\n3. Vote for a category - Once you have the closest items, you see which category they belong to. The category that appears the most among those neighbors is the one you assign to your new item.\n\nSo, if most of the three closest animals are cats, you would classify the new animal as a cat! KNN is like asking your friends for their opinions to decide what you should do.\n\nThe function KNeighborsClassifier does these three steps for you.

It tells us the percentage of correct predictions out of the total predictions made. To compute it, we compare the model's predictions to the actual outcomes, count how many predictions were correct, and then divide that number by the total number of predictions. For example, if our model made 10 predictions and got 6 of them right, the accuracy would be 60%.
