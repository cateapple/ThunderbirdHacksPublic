You'll notice that the content doesn't change but there's a lot of extra stuff in the cell. That stuff helps format the text so it is easier to read. Try double clicking this cell if you haven't already.\n## How to run a cell\nYou can run a cell by clicking the single triangle, or play button, in the menu above.
