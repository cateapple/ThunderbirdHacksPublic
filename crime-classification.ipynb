    "    * `n_neighbors` is the number of points closest to the point we're trying to classify. If we set this number to be too large, we may end up including points from other classes that aren't actually that \"near\" -- this could lead to incorrect classifications! We always try to keep `n_neighbors` to be an odd number... can you figure out why?\n",
    "    * `weights` is a cool way of specifying how \"important\" each point is to the classification of a point. For example, if we do 5-nearest neighbor, and four points are really close to the point we're trying to figure out, but the fifth is really far away (maybe even in another class!), we might want it to be less influential than the four closer ones. In that case, we might use a `distance` metric of weights. By default, however, all points are equally weighted (using a `uniform` weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Help! How do I try different parameters?** Parameters are specific details you can give your code to individualize your functions a bit more. For example, you might want to try using 3 nearest neighbors instead of five! We can try different parameters by putting values in between the parentheses of `KNeighborsClassifier()` and specifiying what we want to change. For example, if I want to try 3-NN, I would do `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 3)`. You can also have multiple parameters at once! For example: `KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 3, weights = distance)`."
